A simple Napster-like file sharing system.
Napster is first widely used service for ‘free’ peer-to-peer (P2P) music sharing. ArticleShare
application will provide p2p article sharing which is very similar to Napster. Here are some high-level
design requirements of this system.
1. A centralized server keeps track of which clients store what files.
2. A client informs the server as to what files are contained in its local repository, but does not actually transmit file-data to the server.
3. When a client requires a file that does not belong to its repository, a request is sent to the server.
The server identifies some other client who stores the requested file and sends its
identity to the requesting client. The file is then directly fetched by the requesting client from
the node that has a copy of the file without requiring any server intervention.
4. Multiple clients could be downloading different files from a target client at a given point in time.
